Please use this content at your own discretion.\r\n\r\nMust deploy the 'Top 100k Passwords' community feed.\r\n\r\nThe use of dictionary-based or common passwords can be an issue as adversaries can easily get or bruteforce these accounts. Depending on the protocol used when authenticating, NetWitness is able to see the password in clear-text, such as for LDAP, HTTP, SMTP, â€¦ Seeing common or dictionary-based passwords in the environment can be indicative of either a username with actually a weak password, or indicative of an adversary performing a bruteforce/password guessing attack using a dictionary.\r\n\r\nThis rule detects when a clear-text password is part of the top 100k list of most common passwords.\r\n\r\nThe IP Whitelist field allows to add a comma seperated list of known and trusted IP addresses that are known and expected to perform this behavior. Use an empty space to clear the field.\r\nMultiple values must be comma seperated.
