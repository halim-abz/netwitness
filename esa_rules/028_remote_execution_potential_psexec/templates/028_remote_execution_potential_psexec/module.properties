PsExec can be used to execute commands or payloads via a temporary Windows service created through the service control manager API. Tools such as PsExec and sc.exe can accept remote servers as arguments and may be used to conduct remote execution. Adversaries may leverage these mechanisms to execute malicious content. This can be done by either executing a new or modified service. This technique is the execution used in conjunction with Windows Service during service persistence or privilege escalation.\r\n\r\nThis rule detects when a remote service is created and executed, which can be indicative a remote execution with PsExec.\r\n\r\nThe IP Whitelist field allows to add a comma seperated list of known and trusted source IP addresses that are known and expected to perform this behavior. Use an empty space to clear the field.\r\nMultiple values must be comma seperated.
