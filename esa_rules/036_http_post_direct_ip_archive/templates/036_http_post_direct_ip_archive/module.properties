The data may also be sent to an alternate network location from the main command and control server. This could be done over protocols such as HTTP and HTTPS.\r\n\r\nThis rule detectswhen an archive file (zip, rar, ...) is uploaded over HTTP in a manner that does not seem human like (POST, no GET, no Referer, Direct to IP).\r\n\r\nThe IP Whitelist field allows to add a comma seperated list of known and trusted destination IP addresses that are known to have similar behavior. Use an empty space to clear the field.\r\nMultiple values must be comma seperated.
