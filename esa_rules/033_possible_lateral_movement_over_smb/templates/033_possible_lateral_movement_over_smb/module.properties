module_desc_long=Disclaimer: This rule is provided by the community and is not officially reviewed, tested, endorsed, or supported by NetWitness. We cannot guarantee the reliability of this rule. Please use this content at your own discretion.\r\n\r\nSMB is a file, printer, and serial port sharing protocol for Windows machines on the same network or domain. Adversaries may use SMB to interact with file shares, allowing them to move laterally throughout a network. Windows systems have hidden network shares that are accessible only to administrators and provide the ability for remote file copy and other administrative functions. Example network shares include C$, ADMIN$, and IPC$. Adversaries may use this technique in conjunction with administrator-level Valid Accounts to remotely access a networked system over SMB.\r\n\r\nThis rule detects when administrative shares are used.\r\n\r\nThe IP Whitelist field allows to add a comma seperated list of known and trusted source IP addresses that are known and expected to perform this behavior. Use an empty space to clear the field.\r\nMultiple values must be comma seperated.
