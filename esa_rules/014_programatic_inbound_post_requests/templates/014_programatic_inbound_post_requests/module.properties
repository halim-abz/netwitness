Please use this content at your own discretion.\r\n\r\nAdversaries may backdoor web servers with web shells to establish persistent access to systems. A Web Shell is a Web script that is placed on an openly accessible Web server to allow an adversary to access the Web server as a gateway into a network. A Web shell may provide a set of functions to execute or a command-line interface on the system that hosts the Web server. Often adversaries access their Web Shell using a tool instead of through a browser, which can lead to behaviors not in line with typical human user browsing behavior, such as POST without a GET, missing headers such as the lack of a referer, missing or strange user-agent values ... Since the Web Shell can be used to provide interactive shell access, multiple POST requests would happen in a short period of time.\r\n\r\nThis rule detects when multiple inbound sessions, with a POST without a GET, and no referer value are seen between the same source and destination IP addresses.\r\n\r\nPossible false positives: in specific cases, such as with legitimate API integrations, this behavior can be expected and normal. Traffic to trusted destinations can be whitelisted (comma seperated).
