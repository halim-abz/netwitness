Please use this content at your own discretion.\r\n\r\nAdversaries may attempt to scan for a specific service across the local network infrastructure to identify where this service may be running.\r\n\r\nThis rule detects when there is an attempt to connect to multiple unique destination IPs over one of the most commonly scanned TCP ports. It will trigger if all connections attempts are to the same port but to multiple different unique IP destinations.\r\n\r\nThe IP Whitelist field allows to add a comma seperated list of known and trusted IP addresses that are known to have a similar behavior, such as internal vulnerability scanners. Use an empty space to clear the field.\r\nMultiple values must be comma seperated.
