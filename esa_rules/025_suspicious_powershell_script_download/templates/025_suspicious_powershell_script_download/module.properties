module_desc_long=Disclaimer: This rule is provided by the community and is not officially reviewed, tested, endorsed, or supported by NetWitness. We cannot guarantee the reliability of this rule. Please use this content at your own discretion.\r\n\r\nAdversaries may transfer tools or other files from an external system into a compromised environment. For example, an adversary could download a PowerShell script from a github repository and execute it on the victim's machine. Furthermore, directly accessing a PS script using the powershell command could allow the adversary to directly execute the script in memory without the file being written to disk (fileless attack).\r\n\r\nThis rule detects when a PowerShell script is downloaded over HTTP with patterns that may indicate being downloaded by a tool rather than a user, such as without a referer.\r\n\r\nThe IP Whitelist field allows to add a comma seperated list of known and trusted destination IP addresses that are known and expected to have this behavior. Use an empty space to clear the field.\r\nMultiple values must be comma seperated.
