Please use this content at your own discretion.\r\n\r\nAdversaries may use an existing, legitimate external Web service to exfiltrate data rather than their primary command and control channel. Popular Web services acting as an exfiltration mechanism may give a significant amount of cover due to the likelihood that hosts within a network are already communicating with them prior to compromise. Firewall rules may also already exist to permit traffic to these services. Since the use of the Telegram API and the creation of bots on Telegram is free and easy to do, it can commonly be used for such purposes.\r\n\r\nThis rule detects when possible data exfiltration is happening over the Telegram API.\r\n\r\nThe IP Whitelist field allows to add a comma seperated list of known and trusted source IP addresses that are known and expected to have this behavior. Use an empty space to clear the field.\r\nMultiple values must be comma seperated.
