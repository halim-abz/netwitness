Please use this content at your own discretion.\r\n\r\nKerberoasting is a post-exploitation attack technique that attempts to obtain a password hash of an Active Directory account that has a Service Principal Name. In such an attack, an authenticated domain user requests a Kerberos ticket for an SPN. The retrieved Kerberos ticket is encrypted with the hash of the service account password affiliated with the SPN. The adversary then works offline to crack the password hash, often using brute force techniques. Once the plaintext credentials of the service account are obtained, the adversary can impersonate the account owner and inherit access to any systems, assets or networks granted to the compromised account. Attackers often take advantage of Microsoft legacy support for Kerberos RC4 encryption since it is easier and faster to crack. When requesting TGS tickets, attackers can force them to use RC4 encryption.\r\n\r\nThis rule detects when Kerberos is used with a weak encryption algorythm, such as RC4 or DES, commonly used as part of Kerberoasting attacks.\r\n\r\nPotential false positives: in some cases, legacy applications may still be required to use RC4. If the use of RC4 is mandatory for these applications, these exceptions should be whitelisted on a case by case basis (comma seperated).
