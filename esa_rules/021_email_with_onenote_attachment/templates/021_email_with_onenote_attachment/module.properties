Spearphishing attachment is a specific variant of spearphishing. Spearphishing attachment is different from other forms of spearphishing in that it employs the use of malware attached to an email. All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and usually rely upon User Execution to gain execution.\r\n\r\nAdversaries may specifically use OneNote files for the delivery of the malware since the method does not involve macros and is easy to create, which can lead to a higher chance of a succesful compromise.\r\n\r\nSince it is usually uncomon for users to attach OneNote files to emails, this rule detects when an attachment includes a OneNote file.
