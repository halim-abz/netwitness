module_desc_long=Disclaimer: This rule is provided by the community and is not officially reviewed, tested, endorsed, or supported by NetWitness. We cannot guarantee the reliability of this rule. Please use this content at your own discretion.\r\n\r\nEnable this rule only if you have an explicit proxy, and make sure to include the comma seperated list of approved proxy server IP addresses.\r\n\r\nIf an explicit proxy is in use, all user web traffic should go through the proxy server. Some malware might ignore the proxy configuration (either intentionally to try and bypass security features of the proxy, or unintentionally by the attacker overlooking it).\r\n\r\nThis rule detects when a web session attempts to directly connect to the internet without going through the proxy.\r\n\r\nThe IP Whitelist field allows to add a comma seperated list of known and trusted source IP addresses that are allowed to have direct internet access. Use an empty space to clear the field.\r\nMultiple values must be comma seperated.
