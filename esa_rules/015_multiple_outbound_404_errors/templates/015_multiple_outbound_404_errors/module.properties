Please use this content at your own discretion.\r\n\r\nAn adversary may have had already compromised and infected a machine, which beacons our to a specific C2 server. If at some point the C2 server is brought down, the infected machine may still attempt to reach out to the C2 server, and if this communication is over HTTP, would return a 404 error.\r\n\r\nThis rule detects when between the same source and destination IP addresses we see multiple 404 error codes.\r\n\r\nThe IP Whitelist field allows to add a comma seperated list of known and trusted destination IP addresses that are known to have a similar behavior, but are known not to be malicious. Use an empty space to clear the field.\r\nMultiple values must be comma seperated.
