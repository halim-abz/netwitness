Please use this content at your own discretion.\r\n\r\nAdversaries may abuse BITS jobs to persistently execute code and perform various background tasks. Windows Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) is a low-bandwidth, asynchronous file transfer mechanism exposed through Component Object Model (COM). BITS is commonly used by updaters, messengers, and other applications preferred to operate in the background (using available idle bandwidth) without interrupting other networked applications. File transfer tasks are implemented as BITS jobs, which contain a queue of one or more file operations. Adversaries may abuse BITS to download, execute, and even clean up after running malicious code.\r\n\r\nThis rule detects when a BITS Job is used to download executables from uncommon locations.\r\n\r\nThe IP Whitelist field allows to add a comma seperated list of known and trusted destination IP addresses from where such files can be downloaded. Use an empty space to clear the field.\r\nMultiple values must be comma seperated.
