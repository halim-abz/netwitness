module_desc_long=Disclaimer: This rule is provided by the community and is not officially reviewed, tested, endorsed, or supported by NetWitness. We cannot guarantee the reliability of this rule. Please use this content at your own discretion.\r\n\r\nIt is usually abnormal to commonly see outbound network connections initiated by Lolbas tools such as 'certutil', 'bitsadmin', or 'microsoft office', and if legitimate, happens only between specific systems. 'certutil' and 'bitsadmin' can often be used by adversaries to download additional scripts and tools after they get initial access to a system.\r\n\r\nThis rule automatically and continuously learns which destination IP addresses have been reached using one of these tools, and alerts whenever it detects a new destination never seen before.
