# Module Definition Properties
module_name=Possible Lateral Movement Over SMB
module_desc=Detects when C$ and Admin$ administrative shares are used.
module_desc_long=Adversaries may use SMB to interact with file shares, allowing them to move laterally throughout a network. Windows systems have hidden network shares that are accessible only to administrators and provide the ability for remote file copy and other administrative functions. Example network shares include C$, ADMIN$, and IPC$. Adversaries may use this technique in conjunction with administrator-level Valid Accounts to remotely access a networked system over SMB.\r\n\r\nThis rule detects when C$ and Admin$ administrative shares are used.\r\n\r\nThe IP Whitelist field allows to add a comma separated list of known and trusted source IP addresses that are known and expected to perform this behavior. Use an empty space to clear the field. Multiple values must be comma separated.
