# Module Definition Properties
module_name=Outbound Connection to Suspicious Certificate
module_desc=Detects when an outbound connection to a domain using a suspicious certificate is seen. These include certificates issued in the last day, week, or expired certificates. The list of certificate anomalies is configurable (analysis.service values).
module_desc_long=This rule detects when an outbound connection to a domain using a suspicious certificate is seen. These include certificates issued in the last day, week, or expired certificates. The list of certificate anomalies is configurable (analysis.service values).\r\n\r\nThe IP Whitelist field allows to add a comma separated list of known and trusted destination IP addresses that are known and expected to perform this behavior. Use an empty space to clear the field. Multiple values must be comma separated.\r\n\r\nUsing the "top 10k domains" feed allows to automatically whitelist common domains (could potentially whitelist true positives).\r\n\r\nSteps for creating the custom "top 10k domains" feed:\r\n1. Create a CSV file where:\r\n** the 1st column has the top 10k most common domains\r\n** the 2nd column, for all rows, is: top 10k domain\r\n2. Deploy the custom feed:\r\n** Config > Custom Feeds > +\r\n** Type: Non IP\r\n** Index Column: 1\r\n** Callback Key: domain\r\n** Column 2: analysis.session\r\n3. Change the ESA rule's "top 10k feed" option from "no" to "yes".\r\n\r\nSample source of top domains: https://radar.cloudflare.com/domains
