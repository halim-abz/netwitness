# Module Definition Properties
module_name=Multiple Different HTTP 4xx Errors
module_desc=Detects when X number of different and unique HTTP 4xx error codes are seen between the same source IP and destination IP within Y seconds. X and Y are configurable.
module_desc_long=Adversaries may communicate using application layer protocols associated with web traffic to avoid detection/network filtering by blending in with existing traffic. Commands to the remote system, and often the results of those commands, will be embedded within the protocol traffic between the client and server. In some cases, adversaries may use HTTP Status Codes to send commands, where each status code means a different command. For example, the Turla APT group has used such methods in the past where Status Code '423' meant 'install persistence and drop files to disk', code '424' meant 'fingerprint the target', code '429' meant 'enumerate network resources', â€¦\r\n\r\nThis rule detects when X number of different and unique HTTP 4xx error codes are seen between the same source IP and destination IP within Y seconds. X and Y are configurable.\r\n\r\nThe IP Whitelist field allows to add a comma separated list of known and trusted IP addresses that are known to have a similar behavior, such as internal vulnerability scanners. Use an empty space to clear the field. Multiple values must be comma separated.
