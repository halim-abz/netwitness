# Module Definition Properties
module_name=Remote Shutdown
module_desc=Detects when a system is remotely shut down.
module_desc_long=Adversaries may shutdown/reboot systems to interrupt access to, or aid in the destruction of, those systems. Operating systems may contain commands to initiate a shutdown/reboot of a machine or network device. In some cases, these commands may also be used to initiate a shutdown/reboot of a remote computer or network device. Shutting down or rebooting systems may disrupt access to computer resources for legitimate users while also impeding incident response/recovery.\r\n\r\nThis rule detects when a system is remotely shut down.\r\n\r\nThe IP Whitelist field allows to add a comma separated list of known and trusted source IP addresses that are known and expected to perform this behavior. Use an empty space to clear the field. Multiple values must be comma separated.
