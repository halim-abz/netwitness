# Module Definition Properties
module_name=[NWC] Communication to Same Domain with Many Subdomains
module_desc=Detects when the same source IP tries to communicate with X number of unique different subdomains belonging to the same domain within Y seconds. X and Y are configurable.
module_desc_long=Adversaries may communicate using the Domain Name System (DNS) application layer protocol to avoid detection/network filtering by blending in with existing traffic. Commands to the remote system, and often the results of those commands, will be embedded within the protocol traffic between the client and server. The adversaries may use the subdomain section to either communicate with the C2 server or exfiltrate data through subdomain values:\r\n- the full domain has a maximum size of 253 characters, which leaves a decent amount of characters for the subdomain\r\n- an adversary could encode the data he wants to exfiltrate, cut it into multiple chunks that fit in the subdomain for a domain name he controls\r\n- once the different queries performed and received at the other end, the adversary can extract the different subdomains used, stitch them back together, and decode the exfiltrated data.\r\n\r\nThis rule detects when the same source IP tries to communicate with X number of unique different subdomains belonging to the same domain within Y seconds. X and Y are configurable. The rule also filters out traffic to common domains to reduce false positive (when the top10k domains feed is deployed), which may, in some cases, filter out true positives as well (filtering top domains can be disabled).\r\n\r\nThe IP Whitelist field allows to add a comma separated list of known and trusted IP addresses that are known to have a similar behavior, such as internal vulnerability scanners. Use an empty space to clear the field. Multiple values must be comma separated.\r\n\r\nUsing the "top 10k domains" feed allows to automatically whitelist common domains (could potentially whitelist true positives).\r\n\r\nSteps for creating the custom "top 10k domains" feed:\r\n1. Create a CSV file where:\r\n** the 1st column has the top 10k most common domains\r\n** the 2nd column, for all rows, is: top 10k domain\r\n2. Deploy the custom feed:\r\n** Config > Custom Feeds > +\r\n** Type: Non IP\r\n** Index Column: 1\r\n** Callback Key: domain\r\n** Column 2: analysis.session\r\n3. Change the ESA rule's "top 10k feed" option from "no" to "yes".\r\n\r\nSample source of top domains: https://radar.cloudflare.com/domains
