# Module Definition Properties
module_name=Lolbas Downloading Risky File
module_desc=Detects when a risky filetype is downloaded using a Lolbas tool based on its user agent string. Both the agent-strings and the file extensions to monitor are configurable.
module_desc_long=Malicious actors can use lolbas tools to download files to a compromised machine while trying to remain undetected.\r\n\r\nThis rule detects when a risky filetype is downloaded using a Lolbas tool based on its user agent string. Both the agent-strings and the file extensions to monitor are configurable.\r\n\r\nComma separated whitelists can be used to whitelist different attributes that are known and trusted to have a similar behavior.\r\n\r\nUsing the "top 10k domains" feed allows to automatically whitelist common domains (could potentially whitelist true positives).\r\n\r\nSteps for creating the custom "top 10k domains" feed:\r\n1. Create a CSV file where:\r\n** the 1st column has the top 10k most common domains\r\n** the 2nd column, for all rows, is: top 10k domain\r\n2. Deploy the custom feed:\r\n** Config > Custom Feeds > +\r\n** Type: Non IP\r\n** Index Column: 1\r\n** Callback Key: domain\r\n** Column 2: analysis.session\r\n3. Change the ESA rule's "top 10k feed" option from "no" to "yes".\r\n\r\nSample source of top domains: https://radar.cloudflare.com/domains
