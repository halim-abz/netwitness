# Module Definition Properties
module_name=[NWC] Password Guessing - Protocol with Error Message
module_desc=Detects when X number of failed authentication attempts from the same source IP to the same destination IP and for the same username are seen within Y seconds. X and Y are configurable.
module_desc_long=Adversaries with no prior knowledge of legitimate credentials within the system or environment may guess passwords to attempt access to accounts. Without knowledge of the password for an account, an adversary may opt to systematically guess the password using a repetitive or iterative mechanism. An adversary may guess login credentials without prior knowledge of system or environment passwords during an operation by using a list of common passwords. As an example for failed logins, Kerberos provides the error 'kdc err preauth failed', while SMB provides the 'logon failure' error.\r\n\r\nThis rule detects when X number of failed authentication attempts from the same source IP to the same destination IP and for the same username are seen within Y seconds. X and Y are configurable.\r\n\r\nThe IP Whitelist field allows to add a comma separated list of known and trusted IP addresses that are known to have a similar behavior, such as internal vulnerability scanners. Use an empty space to clear the field. Multiple values must be comma separated.
