# Module Definition Properties
module_name=[NWC] Credential Stuffing Over SMB
module_desc=Detects when multiple authentication attempts happen over SMB from the same source IP to the same destination IP using X different usernames within Y seconds. X and Y are configurable.
module_desc_long=Adversaries may use credentials obtained from breach dumps of unrelated accounts to gain access to target accounts through credential overlap. Occasionally, large numbers of username and password pairs are dumped online when a website or service is compromised and the user account credentials accessed. The information may be useful to an adversary attempting to compromise accounts by taking advantage of the tendency for users to use the same passwords across personal and business accounts.\r\n\r\nThis rule detects when multiple authentication attempts happen over SMB from the same source IP to the same destination IP using X different usernames within Y seconds. X and Y are configurable. Since the SMB parser extracts the username in the 'ad.username.src' meta key (as opposed to 'username' for other protocols), this rule is specific to the SMB protocol.\r\n\r\nThe IP Whitelist field allows to add a comma separated list of known and trusted IP addresses that are known to have a similar behavior, such as internal vulnerability scanners. Use an empty space to clear the field. Multiple values must be comma separated.
