# Module Definition Properties
module_name=[NWC] NTDS Seen Over SMB
module_desc=Detects when the "NTDS.dit" file is seen over SMB.
module_desc_long=Adversaries may attempt to access or create a copy of the Active Directory domain database in order to steal credential information, as well as obtain other information about domain members such as devices, users, and access rights. In addition to looking for NTDS files on active Domain Controllers, adversaries may search for backups that contain the same information.\r\n\r\nThis rule detects when the "NTDS.dit" file is seen over SMB.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: The below can be a breaking change if you have other ESA rules that do not expect the "filename" meta key to be an array. Make sure to update other ESA rules you may have that do not consider "filename" as an array.\r\n\r\nFor better accuracy, you can change the Meta Key Type for "filename" from "string" to String[]":\r\n1. Go to Admin > Services ESA Correlation > Explore\r\n2. Click on correlation > stream\r\n3. Under "multi-valued" add ',filename' to the end of the list\r\n4. Navigate to Config > ESA Rules > Settings > Meta Key References\r\n5. Click on the red "Re-Sync" button (circular arrows)\r\n6- Verify that "filename" now shows as type "string[]"
