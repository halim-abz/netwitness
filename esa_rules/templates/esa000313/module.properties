Such behavior can be indicative of malicious activity, such as ransomware infections where many files are overwritten/created with their encrypted versions.
module_desc_long=This rule detects when a large number of files are written on a remote share (this could apply to writing new files and/or modifying existing files).

The number of write actions within an SMB session that triggers this rule is configurable.\r\n\r\nThe IP Whitelist fields allows to add a comma separated list of known and trusted source and destination IP addresses that are known to have a similar behavior.
