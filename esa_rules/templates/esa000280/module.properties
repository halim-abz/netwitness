module_name=DNS Zone Transfer
module_desc=Detects when a DNS Zone Transfer is identified.
module_desc_long=Adversaries may gather information about the victim's DNS that can be used during targeting. DNS information may include a variety of details, including registered name servers as well as records that outline addressing for a targetâ€™s subdomains, mail servers, and other hosts. DNS MX, TXT, and SPF records may also reveal the use of third party cloud and SaaS providers. Adversaries may use DNS zone transfer (DNS query type AXFR) to collect all records from a misconfigured DNS server.\r\n\r\nThis rule detects when a DNS Zone Transfer is identified (DNS query type of 252/AXFR).\r\n\r\nThe IP Whitelist field allows to add a comma separated list of known and trusted source IP addresses that are known and expected to perform this behavior. Use an empty space to clear the field. Multiple values must be comma separated.
