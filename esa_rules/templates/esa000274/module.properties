module_name=BITS Job Downloads Executable
module_desc=Detects when a BITS Job is used to download executables over HTTP.
module_desc_long=Adversaries may abuse BITS jobs to persistently execute code and perform various background tasks. Windows Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) is a low-bandwidth, asynchronous file transfer mechanism exposed through Component Object Model (COM). BITS is commonly used by updaters, messengers, and other applications preferred to operate in the background (using available idle bandwidth) without interrupting other networked applications. File transfer tasks are implemented as BITS jobs, which contain a queue of one or more file operations. Adversaries may abuse BITS to download, execute, and even clean up after running malicious code.\r\n\r\nThis rule detects when a BITS Job is used to download executables over HTTP.\r\n\r\nThe IP Whitelist field allows to add a comma separated list of known and trusted destination IP addresses from where such files can be downloaded. Use an empty space to clear the field. Multiple values must be comma separated.\r\n\r\nUsing the "top 10k domains" feed allows to automatically whitelist common domains (could potentially whitelist true positives).\r\n\r\nSteps for creating the custom "top 10k domains" feed:\r\n1. Create a CSV file where:\r\n** the 1st column has the top 10k most common domains\r\n** the 2nd column, for all rows, is: top 10k domain\r\n2. Deploy the custom feed:\r\n** Config > Custom Feeds > +\r\n** Type: Non IP\r\n** Index Column: 1\r\n** Callback Key: domain\r\n** Column 2: analysis.session\r\n3. Change the ESA rule's "top 10k feed" option from "no" to "yes".\r\n\r\nSample source of top domains: https://radar.cloudflare.com/domains
