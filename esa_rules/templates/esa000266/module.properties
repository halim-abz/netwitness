# Module Definition Properties
module_name=[NWC] Remotely Add User to Domain Group
module_desc=Detects when a user is remotely added to a domain group.
module_desc_long=Adversaries may manipulate accounts to maintain and/or elevate access to victim systems. Account manipulation may consist of any action that preserves or modifies adversary access to a compromised account, such as modifying credentials or permission groups. In order to create or manipulate accounts, the adversary must already have sufficient permissions on systems or the domain. However, account manipulation may also lead to privilege escalation where modifications grant access to additional roles, permissions, or higher-privileged Valid Accounts.\r\n\r\nThis rule detects when a user is remotely added to a domain group.\r\n\r\nThe IP Whitelist field allows to add a comma separated list of known and trusted source IP addresses that are known and expected to perform this behavior. Use an empty space to clear the field. Multiple values must be comma separated.
