# Module Definition Properties
module_name=[NWC] Executable File Copied to Common Admin Shared Folder
module_desc=Detects when executable files are copied to common folders on admin shares, such as in the "temp" or "programdata" directories. The list of additional file extensions to monitor is configurable.
module_desc_long=Adversaries may deliver payloads to remote systems by adding content to shared storage locations, such as network drives or internal code repositories. Content stored on network drives or in other shared locations may be tainted by adding malicious programs, scripts, or exploit code to otherwise valid files. Once a user opens the shared tainted content, the malicious portion can be executed to run the adversary's code on a remote system. Adversaries may use tainted shared content to move laterally.\r\n\r\nThis rule detects when executable files are copied to common folders on admin shares, such as in the "temp" or "programdata" directories. The list of additional file extensions to monitor is configurable.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: The below can be a breaking change if you have other ESA rules that do not expect the "filename" meta key to be an array. Make sure to update other ESA rules you may have that do not consider "filename" as an array.\r\n\r\nFor better accuracy, you can change the Meta Key Type for "filename" from "string" to "String[]"":\r\n1. Go to Admin > Services ESA Correlation > Explore\r\n2. Click on correlation > stream\r\n3. Under "multi-valued" add ',filename' to the end of the list\r\n4. Navigate to Config > ESA Rules > Settings > Meta Key References\r\n5. Click on the red "Re-Sync" button (circular arrows)\r\n6- Verify that "filename" now shows as type "string[]"
