# Module Definition Properties
module_name=[NWC] Multiple OS on the Same Host
module_desc=This rule detects when for the same source IP, we see a user-agent string claiming to be from different OS types (such as Windows, Linux, Macintosh, iPhone, iPad, Android) within X minutes. X is configurable.
module_desc_long=Adversaries may carry out malicious operations using a virtual instance to avoid detection. By running malicious code inside of a virtual instance, adversaries can hide artifacts associated with their behavior from security tools that are unable to monitor activity inside the virtual instance.\r\n\r\nIt may be possible to detect such instances when:\r\n- the network interface is configured as NAT (uses the same IP as the host OS to communicate over the network)\r\n- by default, the browser will advertise the OS family within the user-agent string (such as 'Windows', 'Linux', and 'Macintosh')\r\n\r\nThis rule detects when for the same source IP, we see a user-agent string claiming to be from different OS types (such as Windows, Linux, Macintosh, iPhone, iPad, Android) within X minutes. X is configurable. This behavior can indicate that an adversary may have installed a Linux virtual machine (often Kali) on a compromised Windows host, or that he created a reverse tunnel between the compromised host and his C2 server on a different OS type, or that he is using scripts/scanning tools with hardcoded wrong user-agent values.\r\n\r\nThe IP Whitelist field allows to add a comma separated list of known and trusted IP addresses that are known to have a similar behavior, such as internal vulnerability scanners. Use an empty space to clear the field. Multiple values must be comma separated.
