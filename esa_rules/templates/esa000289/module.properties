# Module Definition Properties
module_name=Download Risky Filetype from Uncommon Domain
module_desc=Detects when a risky file type is being downloaded from an uncommon domain. This requires the deployment of the "top 10k domains" feed to exclude common domains. The list of extensions to monitor is configurable.
module_desc_long=This rule detects when a risky file type is being downloaded from an uncommon domain. This requires the deployment of the "top 10k domains" feed to exclude common domains. The list of extensions to monitor is configurable.\r\n\r\nComma separated whitelists can be used to whitelist different attributes that are known and trusted to have a similar behavior.\r\n\r\nSteps for creating the custom "top 10k domains" feed:\r\n1. Create a CSV file where:\r\n** the 1st column has the top 10k most common domains\r\n** the 2nd column, for all rows, is: top 10k domain\r\n2. Deploy the custom feed:\r\n** Config > Custom Feeds > +\r\n** Type: Non IP\r\n** Index Column: 1\r\n** Callback Key: domain\r\n** Column 2: analysis.session\r\n3. Change the ESA rule's "top 10k feed" option from "no" to "yes".\r\n\r\nSample source of top domains: https://radar.cloudflare.com/domains\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: The below can be a breaking change if you have other ESA rules that do not expect the "filename" meta key to be an array. Make sure to update other ESA rules you may have that do not consider "filename" as an array.\r\n\r\nFor better accuracy, you can change the Meta Key Type for "filename" from "string" to String[]":\r\n1. Go to Admin > Services ESA Correlation > Explore\r\n2. Click on correlation > stream\r\n3. Under "multi-valued" add ',filename' to the end of the list\r\n4. Navigate to Config > ESA Rules > Settings > Meta Key References\r\n5. Click on the red "Re-Sync" button (circular arrows)\r\n6- Verify that "filename" now shows as type "string[]"
