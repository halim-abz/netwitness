# Module Definition Properties
module_name=DGA Multiple Failed Unique Domain Resolutions
module_desc=Detects when multiple A Record DNS request returning no IP resolution for X number of different unique domain names are initiated from the same source IP within Y minutes. X and Y are configurable.
module_desc_long=Adversaries may make use of Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) to dynamically identify a destination domain for command and control traffic rather than relying on a list of static IP addresses or domains. This has the advantage of making it much harder for defenders to block, track, or take over the command and control channel, as there potentially could be thousands of domains that malware can check for instructions.\r\n\r\nWhen the adversary generates the domains, he may just register a few of them at a time based on needs, and the malware will automatically rotate through them until it's able to reach one of them. Such a behavior would typically generate DNS requests that don't return any IP address for the resolution of a domain that has not yet been registered.\r\n\r\nThis rule detects when multiple A Record DNS request returning no IP resolution for X number of different unique domain names are initiated from the same source IP within Y minutes. X and Y are configurable.\r\n\r\nIt's recommended to whitelist and exclude internal top level domains (comma separated) to reduce potential false positives, since typically DGA would be done over public domains.\r\nThe IP Whitelist field allows to add a comma separated list of known and trusted IP addresses that are known to have a similar behavior, such as internal vulnerability scanners. Use an empty space to clear the field. Multiple values must be comma separated.
