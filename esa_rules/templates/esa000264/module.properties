# Module Definition Properties
module_name=[NWC] Suspicious PowerShell Script Download
module_desc=Detects when a PowerShell script is downloaded over HTTP without a referrer, which may indicate being downloaded by a tool or script rather than a legitimate user.
module_desc_long=Adversaries may transfer tools or other files from an external system into a compromised environment. For example, an adversary could download a PowerShell script from a GitHub repository and execute it on the victim's machine. Furthermore, directly accessing a PS script using the PowerShell command could allow the adversary to directly execute the script in memory without the file being written to disk (fileless attack).\r\n\r\nThis rule detects when a PowerShell script is downloaded over HTTP without a referrer, which may indicate being downloaded by a tool or script rather than a legitimate user.\r\n\r\nThe IP Whitelist field allows to add a comma separated list of known and trusted destination IP addresses that are known and expected to have this behavior. Use an empty space to clear the field. Multiple values must be comma separated.\r\n\r\nUsing the "top 10k domains" feed allows to automatically whitelist common domains (could potentially whitelist true positives).\r\n\r\nSteps for creating the custom "top 10k domains" feed:\r\n1. Create a CSV file where:\r\n** the 1st column has the top 10k most common domains\r\n** the 2nd column, for all rows, is: top 10k domain\r\n2. Deploy the custom feed:\r\n** Config > Custom Feeds > +\r\n** Type: Non IP\r\n** Index Column: 1\r\n** Callback Key: domain\r\n** Column 2: analysis.session\r\n3. Change the ESA rule's "top 10k feed" option from "no" to "yes".\r\n\r\nSample source of top domains: https://radar.cloudflare.com/domains
