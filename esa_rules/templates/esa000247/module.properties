# Module Definition Properties
module_name=[NWC] Password Guessing over RDP
module_desc=Detects when X number of authentication attempts from the same source IP to the same destination IP and for the same username are seen over RDP within Y seconds. X and Y are configurable.
module_desc_long=Adversaries with no prior knowledge of legitimate credentials within the system or environment may guess passwords to attempt access to accounts. Without knowledge of the password for an account, an adversary may opt to systematically guess the password using a repetitive or iterative mechanism. An adversary may guess login credentials without prior knowledge of system or environment passwords during an operation by using a list of common passwords.\r\n\r\nSome protocols don't have a clear-text password and don't include an authentication error message, such as for RDP. But since RDP provides partially the username, and that it is unlikely for the same user to authenticate multiple times to the same machine with the same account in a short period of time, this can be an opportunity to detect potential password guessing over RDP.\r\n\r\nThis rule detects when X number of authentication attempts from the same source IP to the same destination IP and for the same username are seen over RDP within Y seconds. X and Y are configurable.\r\n\r\nPotential false positive: since RDP only includes the first few characters of the username in clear-text, it is possible that different user accounts that have the same first 5 characters appear to be the same user (while they are not).\r\n\r\nThe IP Whitelist field allows to add a comma separated list of known and trusted IP addresses that are known to have a similar behavior, such as internal vulnerability scanners. Use an empty space to clear the field. Multiple values must be comma separated.
