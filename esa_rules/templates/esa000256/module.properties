# Module Definition Properties
module_name=[NWC] Multiple Unique User Agents
module_desc=Detects when the same source IP is seen using X number of different unique user-agent values within Y seconds. X and Y are configurable.
module_desc_long=For a specific user, based on the OS and applications used, it is typical to have a small set of user-agent/client values. It is abnormal and unusual to see the same user generating network sessions with many different user-agents values within a short period of time and may be indicative of suspicious activity, such as vulnerability scanning, user-agent fuzzing, or other tools and activity.\r\n\r\nThis rule detects when the same source IP is seen using X number of different unique user-agent values within Y seconds. X and Y are configurable.\r\n\r\nThe IP Whitelist field allows to add a comma separated list of known and trusted IP addresses that are known to have a similar behavior, such as internal vulnerability scanners. Use an empty space to clear the field. Multiple values must be comma separated.
