# Module Definition Properties
module_name=[NWC] Exfiltration Over the Telegram API
module_desc=Detects when either a file is uploaded using the Telegram API (if traffic is clear-text), or if a session larger than 10 MB is seen using the Telegram API (if traffic is encrypted).
module_desc_long=Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external Web service to exfiltrate data rather than their primary command and control channel. Popular Web services acting as an exfiltration mechanism may give a significant amount of cover due to the likelihood that hosts within a network are already communicating with them prior to compromise. Firewall rules may also already exist to permit traffic to these services. Since the use of the Telegram API and the creation of bots on Telegram is free and easy to do, it can commonly be used for such purposes.\r\n\r\nThis rule detects when either a file is uploaded using the Telegram API (if traffic is clear-text), or if a session larger than 10 MB is seen using the Telegram API (if traffic is encrypted).\r\n\r\nThe IP Whitelist field allows to add a comma separated list of known and trusted source IP addresses that are known and expected to have this behavior. Use an empty space to clear the field. Multiple values must be comma separated.
