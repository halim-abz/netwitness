# Module Definition Properties
module_name=[NWC] Potential File Containing Passwords 
module_desc=Detected when filenames are seen over SMB with common document file extensions may include strings in the filename that may indicate their use for storing passwords in clear. Lists of filename strings are configurable.
module_desc_long=Users might store passwords in files on their machines instead of using password managers. If an attacker gets hold of such files he may gain access to those passwords and leverage them for lateral movement or privilege escalation. Often users name those file with obvious names, such as "passwords.txt".\r\n\r\nThis rule detected when filenames are seen over SMB with common document file extensions may include strings in the filename that may indicate their use for storing passwords in clear. Lists of filename strings are configurable.\r\n\r\nThe IP Whitelist fields allows to add a comma separated list of known and trusted source and destination IP addresses that are known and expected to perform this behavior. Use an empty space to clear the field. Multiple values must be comma separated.\r\n\r\nFilename matching logic: the "%" sign acts as a wildcard.\r\nExample: to match with "my_passwords.txt", you can use "%passw%txt"\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: The below can be a breaking change if you have other ESA rules that do not expect the "filename" meta key to be an array. Make sure to update other ESA rules you may have that do not consider "filename" as an array.\r\n\r\nFor better accuracy, you can change the Meta Key Type for "filename" from "string" to "String[]":\r\n1. Go to Admin > Services ESA Correlation > Explore\r\n2. Click on correlation > stream\r\n3. Under "multi-valued" add ',filename' to the end of the list\r\n4. Navigate to Config > ESA Rules > Settings > Meta Key References\r\n5. Click on the red "Re-Sync" button (circular arrows)\r\n6- Verify that "filename" now shows as type "string[]"
