# Module Definition Properties
module_name=New Lolbas IP Destination
module_desc=Automatically and continuously learns which destination IP addresses have been reached using one of these tools, and alerts whenever it detects a new destination never seen before. The rule is configurable, allowing to change the initial learning period and when existing values are phased out.
module_desc_long=It is usually abnormal to commonly see outbound network connections initiated by Lolbas tools such as 'certutil', 'bitsadmin', or 'microsoft office', and if legitimate, happens only between specific systems. 'certutil' and 'bitsadmin' can be used by adversaries to download additional scripts and tools after they get initial access to a system.\r\n\r\nThis rule automatically and continuously learns which destination IP addresses have been reached using one of these tools, and alerts whenever it detects a new destination never seen before. The rule is configurable, allowing to change the initial learning period and when existing values are phased out.Using the "top 10k domains" feed allows to automatically whitelist common domains (could potentially whitelist true positives).\r\n\r\nSteps for creating the custom "top 10k domains" feed:\r\n1. Create a CSV file where:\r\n** the 1st column has the top 10k most common domains\r\n** the 2nd column, for all rows, is: top 10k domain\r\n2. Deploy the custom feed:\r\n** Config > Custom Feeds > +\r\n** Type: Non IP\r\n** Index Column: 1\r\n** Callback Key: domain\r\n** Column 2: analysis.session\r\n\r\nSample source of top domains: https://radar.cloudflare.com/domains
