module_desc=Password Guessing for Protocols with Clear-Text Password
module_desc_long=Disclaimer: This rule is provided by the community and is not officially reviewed, tested, endorsed, or supported by NetWitness. We cannot guarantee the reliability of this rule. Please use this content at your own discretion.\r\n\r\nAdversaries with no prior knowledge of legitimate credentials within the system or environment may guess passwords to attempt access to accounts. Without knowledge of the password for an account, an adversary may opt to systematically guess the password using a repetitive or iterative mechanism. An adversary may guess login credentials without prior knowledge of system or environment passwords during an operation by using a list of common passwords.\r\n\r\nFor protcols that have a clear-text password extracted, this rule detects when multiple authentication attempts for the same username are done using different passwords within a short period of time.\r\n\r\nThe IP Whitelist field allows to add a comma seperated list of known and trusted IP addresses that are known to have a similar behavior, such as internal vulnerability scanners. Use an empty space to clear the field.\r\nMultiple values must be comma seperated.
