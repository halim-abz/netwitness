module_desc_long=Disclaimer: This rule is provided by the community and is not officially reviewed, tested, endorsed, or supported by NetWitness. We cannot guarantee the reliability of this rule. Please use this content at your own discretion.\r\n\r\nLDAP reconnaissance involves gathering information from an organization's LDAP directory service, which is commonly used in environments like Active Directory to manage user information, group memberships, computer accounts, and other directory services. During LDAP reconnaissance, attackers or security professionals may leverage tools such as Bloodhound to query the directory and extract valuable data, graph and map out relationships within the AD and can highlight weak spots, indentify an attack path, or potential vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nThis rule detects when there's behavior likely linked to LDAP reconnaissance, which may typically involve large LDAP sessions.\r\n\r\nMake sure to include a comma seperated list of your existing domain controller IP addresses.
