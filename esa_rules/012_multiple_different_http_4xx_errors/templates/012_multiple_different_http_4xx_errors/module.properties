# Module Definition Properties

module_desc_long=Disclaimer: This rule is provided by the community and is not officially reviewed, tested, endorsed, or supported by NetWitness. We cannot guarantee the reliability of this rule. Please use this content at your own discretion.\r\n\r\nAdversaries may communicate using application layer protocols associated with web traffic to avoid detection/network filtering by blending in with existing traffic. Commands to the remote system, and often the results of those commands, will be embedded within the protocol traffic between the client and server. In some cases, adversaries may use HTTP Status Codes to send commands, where each status code means a different command. For example, the Turla APT group has used such methods in the past where Status Code '423' meant 'install persisitence and drop files to disk', code '424' meant 'fingerprint the target', code '429' meant 'enumerate network resources', â€¦\r\n\r\nThis rule detects when, between the same source and destination IP addresses, we see multiple different 4xx status codes within a short period of time, which is not expected for normal web traffic.\r\n\r\nThe IP Whitelist field allows to add a comma seperated list of known and trusted IP addresses that are known to have a similar behavior, such as internal vulnerability scanners. Use an empty space to clear the field.\r\nMultiple values must be comma seperated.
