Please use this content at your own discretion.\r\n\r\nAdversaries may carry out malicious operations using a virtual instance to avoid detection. By running malicious code inside of a virtual instance, adversaries can hide artifacts associated with their behavior from security tools that are unable to monitor activity inside the virtual instance.\r\n\r\nIt may be possible to detect such instances when:\r\n- the network interface is confgured as NAT (uses the same IP as the host OS to communicate over the network)\r\n- by default, the browser will advertise the OS family within the user-agent string (such as 'Windows', 'Linux', and 'Macintosh')\r\n\r\nThis rule detects when, for the same IP, we see user agents claiming to be from both Windows and Linux, indicating that the the adversary may have installed a Linux (often Kali) as a virtual machine on a compromised Windows host.\r\n\r\nThis behavior can also trigger when the adversary has created a reverse tunnel between a compromised Windows host and his Linux-based C2 server.\r\n\r\nThe IP Whitelist field allows to add a comma seperated list of known and trusted IP addresses that are known to have a similar behavior, such as internal vulnerability scanners. Use an empty space to clear the field.\r\nMultiple values must be comma seperated.
